# ðŸ©º Health Chatbot (NLP + Sentence Transformers)

This project is a Python-based health chatbot built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It answers user health-related questions using sentence similarity powered by **Sentence Transformers** (MiniLM). It includes a simple GUI made with Tkinter.

ðŸš€ Features

- Uses `sentence-transformers` to match user queries with known health-related questions
- Answers sourced from a structured CSV dataset
- GUI built with Tkinter for local interaction
- Supports flexible health topics like symptoms, conditions, and general advice

ðŸ§  How It Works

- Loads a dataset of health questions & answers
- Converts all questions to vector embeddings using a transformer model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)
- Accepts user queries, encodes them, and finds the closest match
- Displays the corresponding answer from the dataset
